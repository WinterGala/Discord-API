# Discord-API
[OBSOLETE] C# Discord API

This is an old custom implementation of the Discord API written in C# for learning purposes. It was never complete and, due to several changes to the API, not completely functional anymore as is. It is being uploaded just for reference and should not be used in any projects due to being deprecated, incomplete, and improperly organized classes.

The way the API worked is by creating a Client instance by passing either the user's e-mail address and password, or a token which would allow bots to consume the API as well. Once the Client was created various events could be subscribed to for receiving and responding to events.
